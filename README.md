# HibernetMiniProject
Hello Visitor, Here I have created a mini project in hibernate. It is a simple banking application where an exiting user can login to the system, and new user can create an account. The session is being created for users after login into the system also the user can perform some operations like withdraw money, deposit money, transfer money and logout
